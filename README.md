portfolio
=========
This project was part of Udacity's website optimization course
to learn techniques to increase the speed of rendering websites.
I made some changes to the udportfolio repository to improve 
the efficiency of the instructor's webpage.  The following are 
comments I made on the Udacity forum in June, 2014:

My page is http://julie1.github.io/udportfolio/  I scored 97 on mobile and 96 on desktop with the pagespeed
insights suggestions by adding async(this doesn't improve the score) to the javascript references, by inlining the css style and google fonts file(the style doesn't improve the score, the google fonts pushes the score way up), and my adding media="print" to the css print file. My mobile score may be better because I cut out the mobile portion of the style file since I don't have a mobile device. I also used an image compressor to compress the photos which did not help much.
